# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the complete migration from PyMuPDF to ByteDance's Dolphin OCR as the sole PDF processing engine for the Dolphin OCR Translate application. This is a mission-critical upgrade that will deliver superior document understanding capabilities, advanced OCR processing, and intelligent layout preservation for professional document translation services.

The migration addresses fundamental limitations in the current PyMuPDF-based architecture and introduces state-of-the-art AI-powered document processing capabilities that can handle complex layouts, scanned documents, and multi-language content with unprecedented accuracy.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Complete PyMuPDF Replacement

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want to completely replace PyMuPDF with Dolphin OCR, so that the application can process PDF documents with superior accuracy and understanding.

#### Acceptance Criteria

2. WHEN PyMuPDF dependencies are checked THEN the system SHALL have zero PyMuPDF imports or references in the codebase
3. WHEN a PDF is processed THEN the system SHALL convert it to high-resolution images (300+ DPI) before OCR processing
4. IF a document processing request is made THEN the system SHALL route all PDF processing through the Dolphin OCR pipeline
5. WHEN the migration is complete THEN the system SHALL have removed all PyMuPDF-related services and utilities

### Requirement 2: Basic OCR Processing Capabilities

**User Story:** As a document processing user, I want the system to handle scanned PDFs and basic layouts, so that I can translate PDF documents reliably.

**Note:** Non-PDF uploads are rejected early with error code DOLPHIN_005 to ensure consistent PDF-only processing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a scanned PDF is uploaded THEN the system SHALL extract text using Dolphin OCR
2. WHEN a document contains basic layouts THEN the system SHALL attempt to preserve readable structure
3. WHEN processing documents THEN the system SHALL maintain reasonable text flow

5. WHEN OCR processing is complete THEN the system SHALL provide the extracted text for translation

### Requirement 3: Basic Layout Preservation

**User Story:** As a translator, I want translated documents to maintain reasonable formatting and layout, so that the translated output is readable and usable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN text is translated and length changes occur THEN the system SHALL attempt to adjust font sizes to maintain readability
2. WHEN translated text exceeds original space THEN the system SHALL wrap text or expand containers as needed
3. WHEN layout adjustments are made THEN the system SHALL aim to keep the document usable
4. IF text length variations are significant THEN the system SHALL apply basic strategies to fit the text

4. WHEN API health is monitored THEN the system SHALL track basic response times and success rates

### Requirement 6: PDF Document Processing Workflow

**User Story:** As an end user, I want to upload PDF documents and receive translated PDF outputs with preserved formatting, so that my document translation workflow is consistent and maintains professional quality.

1. WHEN a PDF is uploaded THEN the system SHALL validate format using basic file extension and header checks
2. WHEN an encrypted or password-protected PDF is uploaded THEN the system SHALL reject it with error code DOLPHIN_014 and message "Encrypted PDFs not supported - please provide unlocked PDF"  
3. WHEN a born-digital PDF with an extractable text layer is detected THEN the system SHALL apply hybrid processing (use text-layer OCR for non-text regions only) for maximum accuracy and speed  
4. WHEN PDF processing occurs THEN the system SHALL preserve font families, font sizes, bold/italic formatting, text colors, paragraph alignment, page layout, positioning coordinates, and reading order  
5. WHEN PDF style preservation is measured THEN the system SHALL maintain reasonable layout fidelity by preserving basic document structure and readability  
6. WHEN round-trip testing is performed THEN the system SHALL compare original and reconstructed PDF files with allowed deviations of ±2pt for font sizes, ±5% for positioning coordinates, and exact matches for text formatting  
7. WHEN layouts are processed THEN the system SHALL attempt to preserve basic structure and reading order where possible  
8. WHEN processing is complete THEN the system SHALL preserve basic document structure and essential formatting  
9. WHEN PDF forms are encountered THEN the system SHALL flatten form fields, preserve appearance streams without translation, and log warning "Form fields flattened - interactive elements not translated"  
10. WHEN embedded multimedia is encountered (audio, video, 3D objects) THEN the system SHALL preserve objects as-is without translation and log warning "Multimedia objects preserved without translation"  
11. WHEN PDF reconstruction quality is validated THEN the system SHALL perform basic comparison tests to ensure:  
   • text content is substantially preserved (>90% accuracy)  
   • document structure remains readable and usable  
   • basic formatting is maintained  
12. WHEN PDF output is generated THEN the system SHALL:  
   • validate PDF/A-2b conformance using veraPDF  
   • run structural integrity checks via qpdf or pdfcpu
