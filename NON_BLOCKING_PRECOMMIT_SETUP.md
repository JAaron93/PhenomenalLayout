# Non-Blocking Pre-Commit Configuration

## Overview

The git repository has been configured to allow commits even when linting or formatting errors are present. The pre-commit hooks will still run and provide feedback, but they will not block commits from proceeding.

## Changes Made

### 1. Modified `.pre-commit-config.yaml`

- **Updated description**: Changed from "prevents future whitespace violations" to "provides linting and formatting feedback but allows commits to proceed"
- **Ruff configuration**: Removed `--exit-non-zero-on-fix` argument and added `verbose: true`
- **Bandit configuration**: Added `--exit-zero` argument and `verbose: true`
- **Added `fail_fast: false`**: Ensures all hooks run even if some fail

### 2. Modified `.git/hooks/pre-commit`

- **Non-blocking wrapper**: Modified the git hook to always exit with code 0 (success)
- **Informative messaging**: Added clear warnings when hooks find issues but commits proceed
- **Graceful fallback**: Handles cases where pre-commit is not available

### 3. Backup Created

- **Original configuration saved**: `.pre-commit-config.yaml.backup` contains the original blocking configuration
- **Easy restoration**: Can be restored if blocking behavior is needed again

## How It Works

1. **Pre-commit hooks run normally**: All configured linting and formatting tools execute
2. **Issues are reported**: Violations are displayed with detailed output
3. **Commit proceeds**: Regardless of hook results, the commit completes successfully
4. **Warning displayed**: Users are informed that issues were found but commit proceeded

## Example Output

When committing with style violations, you'll see:

```
Running pre-commit hooks (non-blocking mode)...
[... hook output showing violations ...]

⚠️  Pre-commit hooks found issues but commit is proceeding anyway (non-blocking mode)
   Consider running 'pre-commit run --all-files' to fix issues manually

[main abc1234] Your commit message
 X files changed, Y insertions(+), Z deletions(-)
```

## Manual Fixing

To manually run and fix issues without committing:

```bash
# Run all hooks on all files
pre-commit run --all-files

# Run specific hook
pre-commit run black --all-files
pre-commit run ruff --all-files
```

## Restoring Blocking Behavior

If you need to restore the original blocking behavior:

```bash
# Restore original configuration
cp .pre-commit-config.yaml.backup .pre-commit-config.yaml

# Reinstall hooks
pre-commit install --overwrite
```

## Configured Tools

The following tools are configured but non-blocking:

- **Black**: Python code formatting
- **Ruff**: Python linting (replaces flake8, isort, etc.)
- **Bandit**: Security vulnerability scanning
- **Pre-commit built-ins**: Whitespace, file format checks, etc.

## Benefits

- **Unblocked development**: Developers can commit work-in-progress code
- **Continuous feedback**: Still get linting/formatting guidance
- **Flexible workflow**: Can address style issues when convenient
- **CI/CD compatibility**: Automated systems won't be blocked by style issues
