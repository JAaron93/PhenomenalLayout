# Performance Improvements and Behavioral Notes

This document captures performance characteristics and behavioral notes for optimized components introduced in PhenomenalLayout.

## OptimizedUserChoiceManager

OptimizedUserChoiceManager is intended as a backward-compatible, higher-performance replacement for UserChoiceManager.

Highlights:

- 5â€“10x faster conflict resolution via pre-computed strategy tables
- O(1) lookup vs O(n) sequential processing (see DYNAMIC_PROGRAMMING_REFACTORING.md)
- Smart caching with TTL and memoization for >90% cache hit rates
- Behavioral differences: additional performance metrics, automatic cache warming
- Backward-compatible drop-in replacement for UserChoiceManager
- Timeline: Original API deprecated Q3 2025, full consolidation Q4 2025

Notes:

- Please keep this document in sync with any behavior or API changes.
- The example in examples/user_choice_integration_example.py references this doc instead of embedding detailed comments inline.

TODO:

- Verify cache hit-rate assumptions (>90%) periodically in CI perf jobs and update if necessary.
- Add links to concrete benchmarks when available.
